# translate-zh

Produce a Simplified Chinese zh overlay for one finalized report. The website's `/zh/`
route loads the overlay and falls back to the English leaf when a Chinese
leaf is missing.

## Scope

One invocation translates one report under `reports/<runId>/`. You write
exactly two siblings:

- `summary-card.zh.yaml` — list-card text and detail-page cover (~11 leaves).
- `full-report.zh.yaml` — entire detail-page body (~1500–2500 leaves).

Do not touch any files other than the two final zh siblings and the
required `.translate-cache/<runId>/` intermediates. Do not edit a
`*.zh.yaml` file directly — the applier writes it from the imported
sparse bundle.

## Start here

The parent agent must use the orchestration runner. Do not reassemble the
export/split/merge/import/apply/check chain inline.

```sh
REPORT=<runId-or-company-name>
npm run translate:zh -- preflight "$REPORT"
npm run translate:zh -- init "$REPORT"
```

After `init`, translate only these cached files:

- `.translate-cache/$RUN_ID/summary-card.translate.yaml`
- `.translate-cache/$RUN_ID/parts/part.NNN.yaml`

`summary-card.translate.yaml` is small and should be handled directly by
the parent. Its `summary.headline` is the list-card sentence; keep it as
one fluent Chinese conclusion. Keep `topStrengths`, `topRisks`, and
`unresolvedGaps` parallel within each array.

Then finalize through the runner:

```sh
npm run translate:zh -- lint-parts "$REPORT"
npm run translate:zh -- finalize-summary "$REPORT"
npm run translate:zh -- finalize-full "$REPORT"
```

Finalization runs a conservative quality gate after the structural check. It fails when a translatable leaf drops year/date anchors or explicit uncertainty qualifiers, or retains a high-confidence translationese pattern from the soundcheck. It emits advisory findings for glossary drift, untranslated ordinary descriptors, half-width Chinese punctuation, and dense `的` chains. Repair only the flagged cached leaf or part and rerun the narrow finalize command.

Use `npm run audit:translations-zh -- --limit 20` for a non-blocking corpus sample. The audit reports hard semantic/style errors separately from advisory glossary drift, untranslated ordinary descriptors, half-width Chinese punctuation, and dense `的` chains. Use the report to target only weak leaves; do not rewrite clean overlays.

To repair existing overlays one report at a time, seed the cache from the
current Chinese files instead of retranslating from English:

```sh
npm run audit:translations-zh -- --report <run-id> --format json
npm run translate:zh -- repair-init <run-id>
```

`repair-init` writes `quality.before.json`, prints the blocking target paths,
and fills the sparse cache with the existing Chinese text. Edit only the
flagged leaves, then finalize with `--keep-cache` and measure the delta:

```sh
npm run translate:zh -- lint-parts <run-id>
npm run translate:zh -- finalize-summary <run-id>
npm run translate:zh -- finalize-full <run-id> --keep-cache
npm run translate:zh -- measure <run-id>
npm run translate:zh -- cleanup <run-id>
```

The measurement is saved as `quality.after.json` and reports error/warning
counts against the repair baseline. Process only one report at a time so each
quality change remains attributable and reversible.

For low-cost model routing, use `gemini-3.8-flash` for summary and long-form
full-report drafts, then use `gpt-5.4-mini` for compact table/figure leaves
where brevity matters. Run deterministic QA after translation and route only
meaning-sensitive or still-awkward leaves to `gpt-5.6-luna`; reserve
`gpt-5.6-sol-fast` for unresolved semantic conflicts. Keep
`gemini-3.5-flash` for search planning and evidence extraction, where its
lower-cost output is easier to verify. The shared policy is in
`../startup-research/references/model-routing.yaml`.

If both zh siblings already exist and no repair is requested, do not rewrite
them; run:

```sh
npm run translate:zh -- verify "$REPORT"
```

When a finalized English report is superseded by a refresh,
`link-refresh.mjs` automatically runs `sync-preserved-fields.mjs` on the
previous report. The synchronizer copies the current English shape and every
non-translatable leaf into existing zh overlays while retaining whitelisted
Chinese text. Use `npm run sync:translations-zh` only to repair historical
overlay drift across the corpus.

`run-translation.mjs` owns preflight, cache paths, sparse export,
splitting, part linting, merge/import/apply/check, and successful cache
cleanup. Final deliverables are only `reports/$RUN_ID/summary-card.zh.yaml` and
`reports/$RUN_ID/full-report.zh.yaml`.

If finalization fails, repair only the offending cached leaf or part,
then rerun the narrowest finalize command. Re-run `init` only when the
cache is structurally corrupted; it refuses to overwrite a non-empty
cache unless `--force` is supplied.

Run `lint-parts` after all `parts/part.NNN.yaml` files have been
translated and before `finalize-full`. It parses every part, verifies the
manifest leaf count, and compares each part's string-leaf paths with the
source bundle so shape drift is caught before any final zh file is
written.

## Subagent contract

Spawn each translation subagent with this prompt, substituting only the
target path:

```
You are translating one part of a Chinese diligence-report overlay.

TARGET (read/write): <workspaceRoot>/.translate-cache/<runId>/parts/part.<NNN>.yaml

Workflow:
1. Read the TARGET file in full.
2. Apply the per-leaf process from .agents/skills/translate-zh/SKILL.md
   (read-through → draft → cover-English revision → final write).
3. Update TARGET in place. Same keys, same array length and order.
   Translate every non-null string value. Leave `null` as `null`.
   Do not add or drop keys. Do not change YAML shape.

Structural guardrails:
- `null` is an index placeholder, not a translation task. Never replace it
  with guessed text, and never write the string `"null"` unless the source
  leaf itself is the string `"null"`.
- Translate table cells cell-by-cell from the source text. Do not fill an
  empty-looking cell from neighboring rows, column expectations, or domain
  knowledge.
- When a block scalar such as `notes: >-` is followed by the next table or
  figure item, keep the next `- title:` aligned with its sibling list item;
  do not indent it under `notes`.
- Preserve `- text: null`, `- label: null`, and similar sparse placeholders
  exactly as `null`.

Hard constraints — do NOT:
- run `node`, `npm`, or any other command;
- invoke any script under `.agents/skills/translate-zh/scripts/`
  (those belong to the parent);
- write anywhere except the single TARGET path (no `/tmp`, no extra
  `.json` files);
- touch the English source under `reports/<runId>/`;
- read or modify any other `parts/part.*.yaml`;
- fetch URLs or invent facts.

Return when TARGET has been updated in place. The parent merges all parts.
```

## Authoritative whitelist

`scripts/whitelist.mjs` is the single source of truth for which leaves
are translatable. The exporter only emits whitelisted paths; the applier
silently drops anything else; the validator byte-compares everything else.
If a new visible-text path appears (new figure shape, new section), stop
and report the whitelist gap. Whitelist changes are repo-development
work, not part of a report translation run.

Use `references/glossary.zh.yaml` for recurring terms. Do not edit the
glossary during a report translation; if a recurring term is missing,
pick one consistent rendering within the cache and mention the glossary
gap after the overlay is complete.

## Invariants — must not change

1. Schema shape: keys, key order, array length, array order. Address
   list items by index — never reorder, merge, or split.
2. IDs, refs, slugs, URLs, dates, enums, numerics, `schemaVersion`,
   `artifact` stay byte-identical to English.
3. Proper nouns (companies, products, models, SKUs) keep Latin spelling.
   Never add a parenthetical Chinese alias (`OpenAI（开放人工智能）` — never).
4. Source titles, publishers, and `keyQuote` text are excluded by the
   whitelist; they stay in the original publication's language.
5. No new facts. No hedging shift. `may` is not `将`. `fails to` is not
   `尚未`. `roughly`, `at least`, `reportedly`, `only when`, `unless`,
   `provided that` survive at the same strength.
6. Punctuation: 全角 inside Chinese sentences (`，。；：？！「」`).
   Half-width with one space on each side around embedded English tokens
   and numbers: `ARR 增长 80%，由 Microsoft Azure 渠道贡献`.

## Translation philosophy — re-author, not translate

The English file is the source of facts, not of sentence shape. Read the
whole leaf, then write Chinese the way an investment analyst at 晚点
LatePost / 海外独角兽 / 远川研究所 would write it from scratch. If your
draft mirrors English clause order, rewrite the whole sentence — patching
words never removes 翻译腔.

Self-check: *could an experienced Chinese analyst have written this from
scratch, without ever seeing the English?*

### Sentence shape — apply before drafting

- Time, place, condition lead. `Y is true when X` → `X 之后，Y`.
  Never `Y，当 X 时`.
- Topic to the front; drop `对……来说`. `For thin AppSec teams, manual
  reproduction is the bottleneck` → `AppSec 团队人手紧，手工复现就是瓶颈`.
- Long noun phrases become short verb clauses. Three or more `的` in a
  row is a smell — flatten to a verb or split.
- Split long sentences. A 30-word English sentence with two relative
  clauses becomes 2–3 short Chinese clauses joined by `，` `；` `——` or
  a period. Subordination is English; Chinese is parataxis.
- Use concrete verbs (`落地 / 拼出 / 卡住 / 砸钱 / 吃掉 / 跑通 / 挤压 /
  撬动 / 顶住 / 守住 / 打穿`) over `实现 / 进行 / 做出 / 完成 / 形成`.
  Collapse `进行 / 做出 + 名词` (`做出决策` → `决定`; `进行验证` → `验证`).
- Active over passive.

### Tone

Investor-memo register: confident, concise, analytical, dense with verbs
and numbers. Avoid 学术腔 / 公文味 / 营销文案腔 (`市场进入策略`、
`相关性分析`、`形成竞争优势`).

Length parity, not character parity. A natural Chinese sentence is
shorter than its English source. If your draft is dramatically longer,
you over-translated qualifiers (`approximately`, `essentially`,
`in the context of`, `in order to`, `with respect to`) — cut them.
Specificity (numbers, names, dates, mechanisms, direct quotes) stays
intact.

### Anti-patterns — rewrite the sentence, do not patch

| Anti-pattern | Rewrite toward |
|---|---|
| 长定语堆砌：`一个针对……的、能够……的、并且……的产品` | 短句串联：`一个产品。它针对……、能够……，也……` |
| 段首 `对……来说 / 对于……而言` | 主语前置：`团队需要……` |
| `通过…… 来 ……` | `靠 / 借助 / 凭 / 用` + 动词，或直接动宾 |
| `在 …… 的过程中 / 在 …… 上` | 删除，或用 `时 / 中 / 里` 一字带过 |
| 被动逐字：`被设计为 / 被要求 / 被使用` | 主动：`团队设计成……`、`监管要求……` |
| `A 和 B 和 C` 串列 | 顿号：`A、B、C`；必要时加 `等` 收束 |
| `正在 …… 中` | 直接动词：`公司在调整` |
| 跨句用 `这 / 这一 / 这些` 指代 | 重复关键名词，或 `上述 / 该` |
| `做出……决策 / 进行……尝试` | 直接动词：`决定 / 尝试` |
| `随着…… 的 ……` | `当…… / 一旦…… / ……之后` |
| 数字前后 `约……的……的……` | `约 X` 后接动词，避免 `的` 连用 |
| `是一个……的……` | 判断句 `X 就是 Y`，或拆为两句 |
| 段段 `这意味着…… / 这表明……` | `因此 / 也就是说 / 反过来 / 换句话说`，或直接给结论 |
| `相关 / 相应 / 对应 / 该等 / 此项 / 之` | 删掉或换具体名词 |
| 同义堆叠：`努力和尝试 / 机会与可能` | 取一个 |
| `此外，/ 然而，/ 而且，` 机械直译 | 删掉，让句子自己接续 |
| `公司称其预期…… / 公司表示其将……` | 合一：`公司预期……` |

### Worked example

- Source: *"OpenAI's product experience depends on model availability, API/tool orchestration, SDK integration, and trust controls; partner channels add deployment reach but also opacity."*
- Stiff: `OpenAI 的产品体验依赖于模型可用性、API/工具编排、SDK 集成和信任控制；合作伙伴渠道增加了部署触达，但也带来了不透明度。`
- Native: `OpenAI 的产品体验靠几样东西撑着：模型够稳、API 和工具编排能跑、SDK 接得上、信任控制守得住；合作伙伴渠道把部署做远了，但也把这条链做模糊了。`

The fix: pivot `依赖于 + 名词串` to `靠几样东西撑着` plus short verb
clauses; turn the abstract noun `信任控制` into the action `守得住`.

### Soundcheck — mental grep your draft

If any of these survive, the leaf is not done:

- 三个 `的` 连用。
- 段首 `对……来说`、`对于……而言`、`关于……方面`、`随着……`、
  `通过……来……`、`在……的过程中`、`在……方面`。
- 空动词 + 名词：`做出决定`、`进行尝试`、`产生影响`、`实现增长`。
- 被动逐字：`被设计为`、`被要求`、`被认为是`、`被使用`。
- 段段 `这 / 这一 / 这些` 指代上文。
- 公文词：`相关 / 相应 / 对应 / 该等 / 此项 / 之`。
- `正在……中`。
- 同义堆叠：`努力和尝试`、`机会与可能`。
- 段段 `此外，/ 然而，/ 而且，`。

## Per-leaf process

For every prose leaf and every multi-word table cell:

1. **Read the part end-to-end first.** Lock recurring terms, proper
   nouns, and acronyms so the same English term gets the same Chinese
   form throughout the file. Mark mechanical leaves (numbers, currency,
   dates, IDs, mermaid blocks) — copy them verbatim. `$60M` is `$60M`,
   never `6 万美元`.
2. **Draft** using the sentence-shape rules above. Note hedges
   (`may`, `likely`, `roughly`, `at least`, `reportedly`, `estimated`)
   and constraints (`only when`, `unless`, `provided that`) — they must
   survive at the same strength.
3. **Cover the English. Read the Chinese alone.** Walk the soundcheck
   and the anti-pattern table. Rewrite any sentence that makes you
   pause **as a whole sentence**, not word-by-word.
4. **Re-open the English.** Confirm no fact, number, hedge, or
   qualifier was lost, strengthened, softened, or invented.
5. **Save in place** to the bundle (`*.translate.yaml`) or your
  assigned `parts/part.NNN.yaml`. The applier writes `*.zh.yaml` from
  the imported bundle — never edit it directly. The runner's finalize
  commands perform the final strict translation checks.

## Table cells

Most leaves in `full-report.yaml` come from `tables/[]/rows/[]/[]` —
short cells, not sentences. They follow stricter rules than prose:

- **Pure numbers / units / currency / percent / dates / IDs**: do not
  translate. "$2.6T–$4.4T", "13.8", "2024", "n/a", "—", "null", "T+1"
  all stay verbatim. Currency symbols stay too — write "$852B", not
  "8520 亿美元", inside a table cell, even though the prose convention
  is the opposite. Cells must align across rows; a column that is
  numeric in 9 rows and prose in 1 row should keep the same form.
- **Single-word status / level / enum-like values**: translate to a
  consistent short term and reuse it across rows. "High / Medium /
  Low" → "高 / 中 / 低". "Yes / No" → "是 / 否". "Confirming /
  Adverse / Neutral" → "证实 / 反向 / 中性". Pick one rendering per
  column and stick to it; do not vary by row.
- **Phrase cells (2–10 words)**: translate as natural Chinese noun
  phrases. Drop articles ("the", "a") and reorder modifiers as
  needed. Keep proper nouns in Latin spelling.
- **Mixed proper nouns + descriptive English**: keep the proper noun,
  translate the ordinary descriptor. Do not leave a whole cell in English
  just because one token is a company, product, API, or market acronym.
  "U.S. enterprise sample" → "美国企业样本"; "Global retail/CPG" →
  "全球零售 / CPG"; "API platform / Responses API" →
  "API 平台 / Responses API".
- **Sentence cells**: apply the prose translation philosophy above.
- **Cells that are mostly proper nouns + a small connector**: keep
  the proper nouns and translate only the connector. "Microsoft &
  Azure" → "Microsoft 与 Azure".
- **Pure model / version / SKU lists**: keep Latin tokens and normalize
  separators if useful. "GPT-5.x, GPT-4.1, o1, GPT-4o" →
  "GPT-5.x、GPT-4.1、o1、GPT-4o" is acceptable because every token is a
  model/version name.

## Figures

Figures (`figures/[]`) are charts. The renderer reads everything from
`figure.data.{items,nodes,edges,points,columns,rows,series,layers,xAxis,yAxis}`,
not from top-level keys, so reader-visible chart text is two layers
deep. Translate every reader-facing string under `data/`; leave
identifiers, enums, refs, and numerics alone.

- **Translate**: `title`, `subtitle`, `summary`, `description`,
  `caption`, `insight`, `basis`, `notes`, `approximationNotes`, the
  axis-label shapes (`xAxisLabel` / `yAxisLabel` / `xLabel` / `yLabel`
  / `xAxis` / `yAxis` / `xAxis.label` / `yAxis.label` /
  `data.xAxis` / `data.yAxis` / `data.xAxis.label` / `data.yAxis.label`
  / `data.xAxis.high|low` / `data.yAxis.high|low`), every
  `label` / `name` / `detail` / `description` / `note` / `notes` /
  `text` / `relationship` / `lowLabel` / `highLabel` / `examples` /
  `context` under `data.items[]` / `data.nodes[]` / `data.edges[]` /
  `data.points[]` / `data.layers[]` / `data.layers[].items[]` /
  `data.layers[].modules[]` / `data.layers[].outputs[]` / `data.series[]`
  / `data.series[].points[]` / `data.columns[]` / `data.rows[]` /
  `data.rows[].values[]`, and journey-map row text:
  `data.items[].actor` / `actors[]` / `phase` / `stage` / `emotion` /
  `channel` / `channels[]` / `touchpoints[]`, plus
  `data.nodes[].risk` / `segment`.
- **Never translate unless the exact path is explicitly listed above as
  visible chart text**: `id`, `key`, `slug`, `type`, `kind`, `layout`,
  `tone`, `status`, `sentiment`, `direction`, `trend`, `confidence`,
  `group`, `stage`, `phase`, `category`, `segment`, `unit`, `value`,
  `displayValue`, `date`, `delta`, `from`, `to`, `source`, `target`,
  `claimRef`, `claimRefs[]`, `sourceRefs[]`, `captionSources[]`,
  `xAxis.high|low` numerics, `yAxis.high|low` numerics. These are
  enum keys, chart geometry, refs, numbers, or publisher names — they
  drive CSS classes and bucketing logic in
  [website/src/lib/figures.mjs](../../../website/src/lib/figures.mjs)
  and [FigureRenderer.astro](../../../website/src/components/FigureRenderer.astro).

`scripts/whitelist.mjs` enforces this list. If a future figure shape
adds a new visible-text key, report the missing whitelist path instead
of editing `FIGURE_PATHS` during the translation run.

Style notes specific to figure text:

- Node / column / row / phase **labels** are 2–6 character headings.
  Translate as short noun phrases; drop articles. "Foundation control"
  → "基金会控制"; "OpenAI Group PBC" → keep verbatim.
- Mixed labels follow the same rule as table cells: keep brands/products,
  translate ordinary descriptors. "Meta / open weights" →
  "Meta / 开放权重"; do not keep the whole label English because it starts
  with a proper noun.
- `detail` / `description` / `note` are one-sentence captions that
  appear in tooltips. Apply the prose translation philosophy: lead
  with the topic, drop `对……来说`, prefer concrete verbs.
- Pure model / version / SKU lists in figure details may stay Latin with
  Chinese separators: "GPT-5.x、GPT-4.1、o1、GPT-4o" is fine.
- Axis labels often carry a parenthetical unit hint
  ("Inference Speed (tokens/sec, mid-size LLMs)"). Translate the
  prose, keep the parenthetical units verbatim:
  "推理速度（tokens/sec，中型 LLM）".
- Quadrant `high` / `low` labels are 2–4 character endpoints
  ("Single market (UAE)" / "Multi-market MENA"). Translate as short
  labels; do not narrate.

## Inspection snippets

If the parent runs an inline Node snippet for inspection, this repo is
ESM. Use `import`, not `require`. Always `cd` to the workspace root
first; `js-yaml` lives in the root `package.json`. Inline Node should be
for one-off inspection only, never the main workflow path.

```sh
cd /home/ythuang/workspace/startup
node --input-type=module <<'NODE'
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import yaml from 'js-yaml';
NODE
```

## Errors and remediation

Repair incrementally. Edit only the offending leaf or part in the
existing cache, then rerun the narrowest finalize/check step. Do not
re-export the whole report unless the bundle is structurally corrupted.

Use the runner first. Drop to lower-level scripts only when the failing
path or part is already known.

- `check-translation.mjs` `missing`: a required `*.zh.yaml` output is absent.
- `check-translation.mjs` `shape`: a bundle or part changed object/array shape.
- `check-translation.mjs` `preserve`: a non-translatable leaf was changed.
- `check-translation.mjs` `translate`: a leaf is still empty or too English.
- `check-part-leaf-counts.mjs`: a translated part changed string-leaf count
  or paths. Use the reported extra/missing paths to restore `null`
  placeholders or list indentation before rerunning.
- `bundle-translatable.mjs import`: the edited bundle no longer matches source shape.
- `bundle-translatable.mjs merge`: a part is missing, stale, or changed sparse shape.

Common repair order:

1. Fix the offending leaf or part in `.translate-cache/<runId>`.
2. For full-report part edits, rerun `lint-parts` until it passes.
3. Rerun `finalize-summary` or `finalize-full`.
4. Only if shape is badly corrupted, rerun `init` and re-translate the
   affected bundle or part.

## Common pitfalls

- Translating an enum value in YAML (the website maps
  `recommendation: research-more` to `继续研究` via `displayLabel`; the
  YAML stays English).
- Reordering, merging, or splitting list items.
- Translating source titles, publishers, or `keyQuote`.
- Adding parenthetical Chinese aliases for companies or products.
- Translating a mechanical table cell (number, currency, date, `n/a`).
- Leaving byte-identical short labels that include an English descriptor.
  Proper nouns stay Latin, but the descriptor still needs Chinese:
  `U.S. federal courts` → `美国联邦法院`; `Series E at $61.5B` →
  `Series E 轮，估值 $61.5B`; `Responsible Scaling Policy v3.2` →
  `Responsible Scaling Policy v3.2（负责任扩展政策）`.
